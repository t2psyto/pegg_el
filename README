Pegg_el is a linux userspace driver for Casio EL-700/EL-5000W label printers.
It scans the USB for your printer using libusb (libusb.sourceforge.net).
Although it is the first Version of pegg_el, it is already capable of nearly
every feature of the EL-700/EL-5000W printer. 
Pegg_el accepts many options. A complete list is given below:


	FORMAT ARGUMENTS            MEANING
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	-w			    Sets the printing width (variable)
				    (DEFAULT: 512px)
	
	-h			    Sets the printing height (fixed to:
	                            64,128,256,384)
				    (DEFAULT: 64px)


        OPTION                      MEANING
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	-t			    Just test the connection and get some
	                            Information about the tape loaded
        
	-C			    Only make a cut
	
	-s0,1 			    Select printing speed 0=low, 1=high
	                            (DEFAULT: 0)

	-f0,1,2,3		    Feed select: 0=no feed, 1=large margin,
				    2=small margin, 3=medium margin
				    
	-c0,1,2			    Set cut mode during printing (If you just
	                            want to cut your printed label, then use -C)
				    0=normal cut, 1=half cut, 2=no cut
				    (Do not use -c1 in combination with -f2, 
				    since it will be of no use for you...)
				    				    
	-d0,1,2,3,4		    Select the density 0=light...4=dark
	
	-o			    Offset (example: Offset 12px => -o12)
	                            maximum: 255
				    
	OUTPUT ARGUMENTS	    MEANING
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

	-H                          Selects print head (only EL-5000W)
				    -H0=256dot -H1=64dot
			
	-O			    Export data to png file instead of 
				    printing
	
	
The default arguments of pegg_el are choosen such that the using of pegg_el
is compatible with the KL/KP Version: pegg. So by just typing

     pegg_el ./test_raw, or pegg_el -d3 ./test_raw


pegg_el will print a label with 512 x 64px.

Here are some examples for using pegg_el:


1) Print an label out of label.xbm.crw  with dimensions of 2048x384:


       pegg_el -w2048 -h384 label.xbm.crw



2) Print a label out of test.xbm.crw with dimensions 1024x256 at high speed
   without cutting it:
   
      pegg_el -w1024 -h256 -c2 -s1 test.xbm
      
      
3) Just cut:      

      pegg_el -C


4) same as 3) but export to save.pnm:

      pegg_el -w1024 -h256 -c2 -s1 -Osave.pnm test.xbm


As you can see it is possible to combine the options to match your needs. 
I would recommend to use the format arguments (-w & -h) everytime you use pegg.
For people who want to develop new software with/for pegg_el can use the
pnm-export to check if their new tools are working correct without wasting tape.
For users of the EL-700 it is possible to simulate a print by using the -H 
(head select) option. If you choose here the 64dot head, the EL-700 will make
a full tranfer cycle without printing anything. 


Hopefully you can use pegg_el. Please test it and report bugs via email
