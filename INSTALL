1) INSTALLATION

Note for EL-5000W users:

Before you can use pegg_el you have to change the USB ProductID of to the one the EL-7000W printer has
in the pegg_el.c file (line 326). 


Pegg_el uses libusb >= 0.1.7(!) (libusb.sourceforge.net)
In order to install Pegg_el 0.11 make sure that you have installed libusb with headers
(meaning you have a file named usb.h on you machine).
Before using the make command please check the variables in the makefile. 
If you own an EL-5000W you will have to add the right productID of the printer in pegg_el.c
as described there in line 333. After you checked everything just type the folowing 
to build and install pegg:

	make
	make install

This will install pegg into the path given in the PREFIX Variable in the Makefile
and copies the manpage into the manpath.
If you would like to clean the projectpath then type

	make clean


2) TESTING

After the installation you may test pegg by doing the folowing:

1. Connect your printer.

2. Try a pegg_el -t to see if pegg recognizes your printer. You should see the type of label you have
   mounted on your printer. (You will have to be loged in as root in order to scan the USB)

3. If pegg_el has found your printer print a test label using the test_raw file. To do so type in
   this command:

   pegg_el -w512 -h128 ./test_raw

   The printer should now print a label with some text on it.

If everything works fine, you are done with installation. Please read the README file, for 
informations about the commandline options and usage of pegg.


3) UNINSTALLATION

If you want to uninstall pegg, just cd to the pegg build directory and type:

	make uninstall
