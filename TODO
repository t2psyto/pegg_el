------

The most important thing: testing, testing and testing. 

Some parts of the code are not well written.

1. So first should be some cosmetic and other enhancements of the code.

2. Next is that i currently doesn't request a print-report at the
   end of the printing progress. So pegg doesn't recognize a printing
   error and cannot display it to the user.

3. Furthermore i have not jet  implemented a good errorhandler for
   the commandline arguments.

4. New software for pegg/pegg_el to make labelcreation easier
